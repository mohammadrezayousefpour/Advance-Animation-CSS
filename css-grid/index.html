          The gourmet diner Au Cheval has expanded from Chicago to New York, and
          they have also opened several Small Cheval locations where they only
          serve their burgers, with much shorter waiting times.

          The warm and fluffy bun’s consistency was perfect. But that was not
          the only flawless thing, as the meat was just as divine. It was cooked
          medium and gently seasoned in order to really enhance the beefy
          flavours. The creamy cheese and well-balanced acidity from the
          dijonnaise and pickles complemented the patty perfectly. And the ratio
          between the patty, bun and accessories was everything we’d hoped for.
          Au Cheval serve one of the best burgers in the United States, and are
          a must-visit for all burger lovers out there. Don’t miss them for
          anything in the world!
